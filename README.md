# Heart-Attack-ML-Deployment
🫀 Heart Attack Prediction – Machine Learning Model Deployment
This project is focused on building and deploying a Machine Learning model to predict the risk of a heart attack based on clinical and personal health features. It involves data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and web deployment using Streamlit.

🚀 Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection.

Model Training: Built and evaluated multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to identify the best-performing one.

Performance Metrics: Used accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve to assess model performance.

User Interface: Created an interactive UI using Streamlit where users can input health parameters and get instant predictions.

Deployment: Fully functional web app ready for demonstration or integration.

📁 Tech Stack:
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Streamlit (for frontend UI)

🔍 Input Features:
Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG

Max Heart Rate

Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression, etc.

✅ Outcome:
This project demonstrates the complete pipeline from data science to deployment, offering a practical application in the healthcare domain. It's useful for learning end-to-end ML workflows and real-world ML deployment.
